/**
 * Buyer payment history.
 *
 * Read-only on purpose. Purchase records are created by
 * `POST /api/orders/checkout`; letting a client POST or PUT a payment would
 * let anyone mark their own payment completed. Admins still see every record
 * (payouts included) because `scope()` skips owner-scoping for them.
 *
 * Non-admins are additionally pinned to `direction: "purchase"` so a buyer can
 * never browse the outbound payout ledger for farmers and logistics vendors.
 * `supplier` is admitted alongside `buyer` for the same reason `/api/orders`
 * admits it: the supplier portal's Payments page reuses this endpoint, and the
 * `direction` filter above already keeps it to that account's own purchases.
